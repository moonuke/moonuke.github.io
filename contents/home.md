I am a PhD candidate at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering/our-research/research-groups/human-centred-computing) and [CSIRO's Data61](https://research.csiro.au/ss/), where I am advised by [Prof. Zhenchang Xing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0vCxuH4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Jieshan Chen](https://chenjshnn.github.io/), [Prof. Aaron Quigley](https://aaronquigley.org/) and [Dr. Gelareh Mohammadi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7rxu6U4AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on **Software Automation**, **AI for SE** and **Human-Computer Interaction** addressing real-world problems that impact automated software development and user interaction. My current work spans three key areas: <span style="color: #3b82f6;">**UI generation**</span>, <span style="color: #8b5cf6;">**code generation and repair**</span>, and <span style="color: #ec4899;">**agent-based systems**</span>.

Prior to my PhD, I was a Senior R&D Engineer (T5) at Baidu's DuerOS, specializing in Computer Vision and multimodal human behavior analytics. I hold a Master's degree in Electronic Engineering and Information Science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by Prof. Dong Yin.
