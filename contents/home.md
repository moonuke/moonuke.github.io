I  -->

I am a PhD student at the University of New South Wales and CSIRO’s Data61, where I am advised by a supervisory team including Prof. Chunyang Chen, Prof. Zhenchang Xing, Dr. Jieshan Chen, Prof. Aaron Quigley, and Dr. Gelareh Mohammadi. My research lies at the intersection of Software Engineering (SE), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Large Language Models (LLMs).

My current work focuses on human-AI interaction in software engineering, specifically in the areas of UI generation, code generation and repair, and agent-based systems.

I hold a Master’s degree in Electronic Engineering and Information Science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I was advised by Prof. Dong Yin.
